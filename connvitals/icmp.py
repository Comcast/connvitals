"""
This module contains convenience functions for dealing with the ICMP protocol.
Most notably, it contains the `ICMPPkt` class, which can construct an ICMP packet object either
from a simple payload and destination (which will make an 'Echo Request' of the appropriate version)
or from a raw bytestring that is presumably an ICMP packet recived from an external host.
