A utility to check connection vitals with a remote host.

	Usage: connvitals [ -h --help ] [ -H --hops HOPS ] [ -p --pings PINGS ] [ -P --no-ping ]
	                  [ -t --trace ] [ --payload-size PAYLOAD ] [ --port-scan ] [ -j --json ]
	                  host [hosts... ]

Each 'host' can be an ipv4 address, ipv6 address, or a fully-qualified domain name.

Submodules:
	utils:      Contains utility functionality such as error/warning reporting and host address parsing
	ping:       Groups functionality related to ICMP/ICMPv6 tests
	traceroute: Contains a function for tracing a route to a host
	ports:      Specifies functions for checking specific host ports for http(s) and MySQL servers
