# Contributing Guidelines
If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through
GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

As far as formatting, the Go compiler is pretty explicit as to what's
allowed, so code is generally acceptable as long as it compiles.

However, do try to keep lines under 100 characters in length to accommodate
people reading your code on standard-sized terminal windows, split-pane
text editors and sideways monitors.

Now some comcast stuff:

## CLA
---------
Before Comcast merges your code into the project you must sign the [Comcast
Contributor License Agreement
(CLA)](https://gist.github.com/ComcastOSS/a7b8933dd8e368535378cda25c92d19a).

If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked
to when you open a pull request. Alternatively, we can send you a PDF that
you can sign and scan back to us. Please create a new GitHub issue to request
a PDF version of the CLA.
